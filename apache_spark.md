## SWAN: Spark connector and monitor

These notebooks exemplify the submission and monitoring of Spark jobs from SWAN.

* [Analyzing monitoring data](apache_spark1/analytix-hostmetrics-example.ipynb)
* [Analyzing LHC logging data](apache_spark1/NXCals-example.ipynb)

## LHCb Opendata

This notebok illustrates a nice interplay between LHCb Opendata, Spark and ROOT - all teaching interesting flavour Physics!

* [An example using LHCb open data](basic/notebooks/LHCb_OpenData_Spark.ipynb)
